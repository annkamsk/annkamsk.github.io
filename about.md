Hej! My name is Anna and I'm a software engineer. I enjoy solving complex computational problems and designing software systems.

My main focus these days is building data systems at [QED.ai](https://qed.ai) and studying Bioinformatics at KU Leuven.

Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:
- python
- Django
- SQL (Postgres)
- Linux
- Typescript
- R 

I'm also a huge singing nerd and a musical theatre kid (yes, you can find my artistic alter ego online ;)) 

I'm based in Europe.
